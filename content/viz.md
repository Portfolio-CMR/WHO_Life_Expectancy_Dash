1. **Connect:** I start by connecting to my data source, whether it's a spreadsheet, database, or cloud service.
2. **Explore & Prep:** I take a good look at the data, clean up any issues, and transform it as needed to get it dashboard-ready.
3. **Build the View:** This is where the fun begins! I drag and drop fields to create visualizations like charts, graphs, and maps. I also customize colors, labels, and tooltips to make things clear and visually appealing.
4. **Arrange & Design:** I put the visualizations together on a dashboard, adding filters, parameters, and actions to make it interactive and easy to explore. I also pay attention to the overall layout and design to create a polished look.
5. **Test & Refine:** I always test the dashboard to make sure everything works as expected. I also get feedback from others and make adjustments to improve the functionality and user experience.
6. **Share & Publish:** Once I'm happy with the dashboard, I publish it to Tableau Server or Online so others can access it and gain insights from the data.

It's an iterative process, and I often jump back and forth between steps as I refine the dashboard. The goal is to create a visually appealing and informative dashboard that helps users understand the data and make better decisions.
